# **Rental Car Android**
A freelance project for tracking rental cars in real time.

## **Description**
The purpose of this project was to allow the rental car owners to track location of their drivers in real time during
job hours.

The drivers can work on hourly basis.

Before starting their job they login to the application and mark themselves available with location detection.

After a driver is available they are assigned tasks in app, like
* Pickup a car.
* Refuelling.
* Car service.

... etc.

Based on work they can mark whether they are near a car to pickup, or snap photos if a car needs refuelling or servicing.
